Here's the deal: Adrian Dittmann is not Elon Musk, and we have concrete evidence.

This began as a story with Jackie Sweet, a freelance journalist with history writing for *The Intercept*, *Mother Jones*, and so on. We found the initial lead and presented it to Jackie, but she was ultimately agreed to be our byliner â€” the actual writer for the story, the sole contributor being credited in the space under the title, and the one being paid for the piece. As such, Jackie got to choose the outlet we pitched to, and we ended up with an article in the US edition of the right-wing *Spectator* that was arguably poorly presented, cut out graphics and information crucial to the investigation, and crucially did not give credit to us.
